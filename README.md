## Why Us?

The competitive sites we have chosen to analyze  is : 
1. __[aqari](http://www.aqari.ps/)__ : 
    - No pages were found to be using defined headings. This means that users and search engines may find it harder to determine the content of this website's page
    - 35 links use text that is too long. Links should describe what they link to briefly.
    - 17 links have no text describing their destination
    - Most images (87.0%) don't have defined sizes using width and height attributes in the HTML.
    - They don't have a custom 404 Error Page.

2. __[rawabi](https://www.rawabi.ps/ar)__ :
    - 3 pages of this website have very little content (20 words or less).
    - 9 links have no text describing their destination
    - No images have defined sizes.

3. __[trulia](https://www.trulia.com/)__
    - Most images (74.0%) don't have defined sizes using width and height attributes in the HTML.
    - 3 links have no text describing their destination.
    - 9 images are being stretched in the browser.
    - Find the tap targets that are too small, their size in pixels, and the overlapping target that is too close to be easily clicked.

The most important site that made us do this site is Facebook.
Most companies and *Real-Estate* establish pages on Facebook and communicate with the customer through it, but it is not an official way to sell, for example, homes, so we resorted to this idea... A site specialized in selling homes and renting student dormitories will be a very good alternative For widespread and unofficial Facebook pages in companies.
