The most important site that made us do this site is Facebook.
Most companies and __**Real Estate**__ establish pages on Facebook and communicate with the customer through it, but it is not an official way to sell, for example, homes, so we resorted to this idea... A site specialized in selling homes and renting student dormitories will be a very good alternative For widespread and unofficial Facebook pages in companies.
