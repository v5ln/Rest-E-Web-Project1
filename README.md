## Who Are We?

__Rest-E__ is an online platform specializing in residential property
services, which aims to make it easier for all to buy. sell, or rent
residential real-estate through our easy-to-use online website
services.

Currently based in Nablus, our continuously-growing platform is
dedicated to serving buyers, sellers, renters, and even universityÂ¬
hostel owners, as the provided services are neatly-categorized to
suit each of the aforementioned group's needs respectively.

Our services provide simplicity, making it much easier and safer to

which has the full details of the retailer or renter to provide
authentic credentials proving the ownership of the *Real-Estate*.

The provided services also include the ability to browse available
residential property freely and easily through our website,
allowing the user to choose from a large library of rental or for-
sale houses with various price-tags and different settings, and

Finally providing them with the required information regarding the
retailer/renter and the various communication addresses.

Our platform supports the different payment methods, whether it's
indirect transfer, Visa card, or in cash.

## Why Us?

The competitive sites we have chosen to analyze  is : 
1. __[aqari](http://www.aqari.ps/)__ : 
    - No pages were found to be using defined headings. This means that users and search engines may find it harder to determine the content of this website's page
    - 35 links use text that is too long. Links should describe what they link to briefly.
    - 17 links have no text describing their destination
    - Most images (87.0%) don't have defined sizes using width and height attributes in the HTML.
    - They don't have a custom 404 Error Page.

2. __[rawabi](https://www.rawabi.ps/ar)__ :
    - 3 pages of this website have very little content (20 words or less).
    - 9 links have no text describing their destination
    - No images have defined sizes.

3. __[trulia](https://www.trulia.com/)__
    - Most images (74.0%) don't have defined sizes using width and height attributes in the HTML.
    - 3 links have no text describing their destination.
    - 9 images are being stretched in the browser.
    - Find the tap targets that are too small, their size in pixels, and the overlapping target that is too close to be easily clicked.

The most important site that made us do this site is Facebook.
Most companies and *Real-Estate* establish pages on Facebook and communicate with the customer through it, but it is not an official way to sell, for example, homes, so we resorted to this idea... A site specialized in selling homes and renting student dormitories will be a very good alternative For widespread and unofficial Facebook pages in companies.
